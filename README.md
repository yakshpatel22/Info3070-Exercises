# Info3070-Exercises
A client/server application which is  designed and deployed in layers. Projects incorporate JavaScript and jQuery clients making REST calls to a ASP.Net Core server. C# is used server-side in conjunction with the Entity Framework, LINQ, and a SQL Server database. This server database is a student management system. The application offers a range of menu options, each designed to facilitate different aspects of student data management. These options include:

1. Home: The starting point of the application.
2. Student Add: Allows the addition of new student records.
3. Grade: Manages and updates student grades.
4. Student Search: Facilitates easy retrieval of student information.
5. Original Lookup: Provides a quick way to access the original database.
6. MODAL: A feature for editing and updating student records.

All of these menu options are interconnected, allowing the user to seamlessly fetch, edit, and delete student data according to their needs. This project represents an individual effort, completed within a span of four months during the semester. It showcases the programmer's skills in database management, user interface design, and application development.
